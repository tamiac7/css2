# Round 2! FIGHT

Let's go! Time to get hairy with some css - we're digging into Grid and Flexbox now! Whoot!

You've got a simple HTML file and an empty CSS file - let's make them better! Follow the
instructions below - don't forget to consult the curriculum if you're unsure on something!

3) Create a new class named .box-with-margin and add a margin of 30px.

4) Change the position of the .static-element class to relative.

5) Move the .relative-element 50px to the right using the left property.

6) Change the position property of the .absolute-element class to relative.

7) Set the top property of the .absolute-element class to 150px.

8) Adjust the position of the .fixed-element class so that it is fixed to the bottom right corner of the viewport.

10) Change the float property of the .column class to right.

11) Change the display property of the .container class to inline-flex.
